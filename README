Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MyMeego is a prototype for a program that allows it's user to share media
between Meego devices. 

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current implementation cannot really transfer files, therefore the 
filelists and transfers are faked by the backend.

Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program you need both the backend and the UI. Both are found in the
same repository, from which you are probably reading this file as well. Backend
can be found in 'ui/daemon/' and the backend process can be started by typing:

python ui/daemon/main.py

The parameter given to the backend is a path to a coherence configuration file
which defines the name of the device as well as the directories from which
content is shared.

After you have succesfully started the backend process you can start the UI
by opening the project in Qt Creator. You should be able to see your own
device in the devices menu. You can start new backend processes in other
terminals to add devices to the list. Remember to modify the coherence.conf
for other backend processes before attempting to start them. You can also run
other backend processes on other devices on the same network and they should be
visible in the devices list.
