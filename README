Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MyMeego is a prototype for a program that allows it's user to share media
between Meego devices. 

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a research and development project and thus it's not a completely working
aplication. There is some things that doesn't actually work.

The current implementation cannot really transfer files, therefore the 
filelists and transfers are faked by the backend. However the technology
used can support such features.

The shared folders is currently not working and it's faked from the backend.
The folder indexing is possible to do, but to ensure best possible working
environment it's faked.


Installing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary way of installing the program is debian packaging (ubuntu & Maemo). 
If you don't have a ready made .deb package, then you need to build this
package yourself. This can be done by running

dpkg-buildpackage

After this you get your packages in the directory above. (probably looks
something like this mymeego_0.0.1_i386.deb). That package can be installed
into your system by running

sudo dpkg -i mymeego_0.0.1_i386.deb

After this the program is ready to be used.

Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program you need both the backend and the UI. Both are found in the
same repository, from which you are probably reading this file as well. Both of 
these have been installed by the debian package installation mentioned above.
Backend can be started by the command

mymeego-backend

You can give a parameter to the backend also. 

mymeego-backend /usr/share/mymeego/conf/mymeego_car.conf

The parameter given to the backend is a path to a configuration file
which defines the name of the device, type of the device, as well as 
the directories from which content is shared.

The application itself can be started with the command

mymeego

This doesn't take any parameters.

Backend usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use application so that you have multiple backends running,
eg. multiple devices. You can do this by starting mymeego-backend in other
devices in your local network, and the devices will popup in the application
when they are started. 

Alternatively you can start another backend instance on your home computer.
In this case you have to use another mymeego.conf file, and modify that one
a little. This modification has to be such that it uses coherence2.conf, 
instead of coherece.conf. This way you are allowed to have several
backend instances running simultaneusly.

If you want to create an another type of device than a mobile phone (default),
then you have either to change device type in mymeego.conf into on of the 
following "phone","tv","netbook","vehicle". 

Alternatively you can start the backend by using a config file with different
device type, which has been made for your convenience. 

mymeego-backend /usr/share/mymeego/conf/mymeego_car.conf

Using Without Installing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the application without the debian packaging and installing it 
that way. In that case you have to open the mymeego.pro file in the QtCreator.
After building the project int creator you can run it from there also.

Backend can be found in the folder /daemon and from there it works the same 
way as the installed. But starting is bit different, instead of 
mymeego-backend you run

python main.py ../conf/mymeego_car.conf

Depends
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qt (>= 4.7)
python
python-coherence
